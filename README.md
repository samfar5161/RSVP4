# RSVP4
Simple RSVP application for Android. Made with Xamarin Forms and C#. 

Class project for CIS 432 - Mobile App Development using Xamarin Forms.

The functionality isn't exactly ready for deployment, but shows some of the Xamarin skills
we were taught in the class, namely
    - MVVM Framework
    - Data Bindings
    - SQLite Database.
